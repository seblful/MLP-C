# Multilayer Perceptron from Scratch in C
This GitHub repository contains a project that demonstrates the creation of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) from scratch and its training on the MNIST dataset. The project is implemented in C and aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of MLPs and their applications. 

The MLP is training on the MNIST dataset, which consists of images of handwritten digits. The training process involves adjusting the parameters.
